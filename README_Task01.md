# Task-01: Distribution Visualisation (Population, Total)  
**Dataset:** World Bank “Population, total” indicator  
**File:** `API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_38144.csv`  
**Visualisations included:**  
- Histogram of population across countries in 2020 (`hist_population_2020.png`)  
- Bar chart of top 10 most populated countries in 2020 (`bar_top10_population_2020.png`)  

## Description  
This project loads a dataset of total population per country from 1960 to 2024, cleans it, and generates two visualisations:
1. Histogram showing the distribution of country-level population in 2020.
2. Bar chart showing the top 10 countries by population in 2020.

## How to run  
1. Open the Jupyter notebook `Task01_visualisation.ipynb` in Google Colab or locally.  
2. Execute all cells.  
3. The plots will appear and also save as PNG files in the working directory.  
4. To upload to GitHub:  
   - Save notebook and PNG files.
